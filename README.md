## Description
This application was created to allow a user to add, save and delete notes. This project was created to show what I have learned about express.js and how to effectively create routes and work on the backend.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

* Clog middleware and notes.js code adapted from mini-project week 11!
